            <h2>About Jomo Kenyatta</h2>
            <p>
                Jomo Kenyatta (c. 1897 – 22 August 1978) was a Kenyan anti-colonial activist and politician who governed Kenya as its first Prime Minister (1963–1964) and President (1964–1978). He played a leading role in Kenya's struggle for independence from British colonial rule.

            <p>
                As a key figure in the Kenyan African National Union (KANU), Kenyatta is often referred to as the "Father of the Nation." He promoted unity and economic development, laying the foundation for a new nation after decades of colonial exploitation.
